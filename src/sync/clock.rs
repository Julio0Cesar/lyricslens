//! The clock that says where the song is between readings.
//!
//! Browsers report `Position` rounded down to whole seconds, so a reading
//! carries up to a second of error and is useless on its own. The moment the
//! integer flips, though, the real position is known exactly — that instant is
//! the anchor, and from there time is counted locally.
//!
//! `Position` has no change signal by specification, so it has to be read on a
//! timer. Everything here is driven by those readings and stays testable
//! without a bus.
